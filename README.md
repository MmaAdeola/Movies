# TMDB_movies dataset analysis
### Introduction
A simple dive into the TMDb movies dataset. 
This dataset contains information for about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database including user ratings and revenue. 
This project was carried out as the first project in the ALX/Udacity data analytics nanodegree. Different datasets were provided and I decided to explore the movies dataset. 

### Questions Answered
Interests in the dataset include:
1. What are the characteristics of highly rated movies?

3. Which three movies have the highest profit?
4. What are the top ten most rated movies?
